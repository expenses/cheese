- Some kind of top-down shooter set on the lunar surface
  - Space zombies
  - Need to collect enough fuel somehow to refuel ship
  - Ideally procedurally generated but thats hard with the timescale.

- Space trading sim
  - Need to do some physics for the moonshot element
  - Would have to make planet sizes bigger for fun factor

- 2D lunar surface death worm game
  - Would go around, destroying habitats etc.
  - Could be fun, but hard to fit with theme

- Something about the moon being cheese and mice
  - Literally copying 'cheese dreams' here
  - Greedy capitalist mice, mining the moon for cheese
  - 2 different factions
  - RTS or TBS? On surface or in space above?
    - RTS would be fun, pathfinding is a pretty sorted problem but getting unit flocking seems like a pain.
