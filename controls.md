# Controls

The controls are pretty standard for a RTS.

- You can pan the camera by pressing the arrow keys or by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.
- The camera can be zoomed in and out by using the scroll wheel.
- Units can be selected by left-clicking. To select a group of units, left-click and drag over them.
- Units can be added or removed from a selection by holding the shift key while selecting.
- To command units to move or attack an enemy unit, right-click on a target.
- To command units to do an attack-move (where units are attacked along the way), press A to toggle the attack-move mode, then left-click.
- You can exit out of different modes by right-clicking or pressing the escape key.
- To cancel unit's current commands, press the s key.
- To set a control group, hold control and press 0-9. Pressing 0-9 again will select the units belonging to that control group.
- To add units to a control group, hold shift and press 0-9.
- To use a unit's abilities, press the assigned key shown on the bottom of the screen. For example if you have an engineer selected and press Q, it will switch to the building mode and allow you to build a pump.
- The number of cheese coins you have is shown in the top-right. If you don't have enough coins to afford an action, it will be greyed out.
- You can select buildings the same way you select units. Some buildings such as armouries allow you to place units into a recruitment queue.
